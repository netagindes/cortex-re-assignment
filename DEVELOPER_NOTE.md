# Developer Note

## Overview

This project uses a local dataset (the assets parquet file) to support a multi-agent system acting as an AI asset menager assistant, designed to perform financial calculations, asset lookups, and general assistance. Implemented using Streamlit client app, FastAPI service, LangGraph-powered workflow, OpenAI API for LLM reasoning.


## Estimated Workflow

1–2 hours — Review the assignment and explore the dataset
1 hour — Plan data flow, identify key use cases, outline architecture
1 hours — Set up the environment, repository, and initial Streamlit app
1–2 hours — Design the data layer, define global/local state, create supporting components
2 hours — Implement the assistant and multi-agent LangGraph workflow
1 hour — Final review and submission


## 📌 Assets Dataset

The dataset can be partitioned into several logical domains:

1. Tenant Information - Contains inconsistencies (e.g., zero values), which must be handled gracefully
	• Represents client or property metadata
	• Contains inconsistencies (e.g., zero values), which must be handled gracefully

2. Ledger Information
   A hierarchical financial chart-of-accounts structure (by order):
	• Ledger Type (e.g., revenue / expenses)
    • Ledger Group (category)
    • Ledger Type/Subtype (subcategory)
    • Ledger Code (description)

3. Timeframe Values
   Inherited hierarchy (month → quarter → year) with consistent formatting:
	• Year: YYYY
	• Quarter: YY-QN
	• Month: YY-MM

4. Ledger Values
	• Numerical “profit” amounts
	• Aggregatable into financial calculations


## 🧠 System Design — Multi-Agent Architecture

### Top Layer: Supervisor / Orchestrator Agent

Responsibilities:
	• Receive and classify all user messages
	• Identify request type:
    	• Financial calculation (P&L)
    	• Asset details
    	• Price comparison
    	• General knowledge
	    • Unsupported queries
	• Dispatch request to the correct specialist agent
	• Aggregate responses into a final user answer
	• Manage conversation loops and stopping conditions:

Decision flow:
	1. If the result is clear → return to user
	2. If flagged as ambiguous → ask for clarification
	3. On error → return a helpful fallback (e.g., missing asset, invalid timeframe, unsupported instruction)

### Middle Layer — Specialist Domain Agents

1. PriceComparisonAgent
	• Retrieves ledger values for each asset
	• Identifies missing/unavailable assets → raise error
	• Ensures at least two assets exist for comparison
	• Returns data for each provided asset and performs comparison

2. PnLAgent (expends to FinancialCalcAgent)
	• Interprets timeframe (absolute or relative to current date)
	• Retrieves all relevant ledger values per asset
	• Handles:
	    •	Missing asset → raise error
	    •	Missing timeframe → return partial result + error
	    •	Ambiguous input → raise error
	• Calculate P&L (expends to more financial calculations)
    • Returns:
	    • Total P&L
	    • Breakdown per asset

3. AssetDetailsAgent
	• Retrieves full asset information using any identifier (address, ledger info, tenant info, timeframe)
	• Raises errors for missing or invalid assets
	• Returns complete, structured asset details

4. GeneralKnowledgeAgent
    • Handles non-property-specific queries:
	    • Current date/time
	    • P&L formula explanation (expends)
	    • Event actions (e.g., “a tenant is stuck in the elevator”)
	    • Referral to appropriate professionals (e.g., plumber)

5. FallbackAgent
	• Generates clarification prompts
	• Determines input relevance
	• Manages ambiguous follow-up interactions

### Bottom layer – Tools

Core Data Tools
	• Property and entity discovery
	• Generic ledger filters
	• Tenant filters

Financial Logic
	• Core P&L utilities
	• Comparison engines
	• Scenario simulation tools

Asset Understanding Tools
	• Output formatting
	• Validation/normalization helpers
	• Timeframe parser
	• Missing-data detection

Conversation & Meta-Tools
	• Loggers
	• Explanation helpers
	• State summarization tools


## 🔥 Challenges and Implemented Solutions

Hallucination 
    • Hallucination in calculation → Clear step-by-step instraction
    • Fake response for non-existing asset request → Define as system demand.

Clarification / Fallback Issues
	• Some queries remained unresolved even after clarification
    → Improved fallback mechanism and message structure.

Invalid Input Handling
	• Difficulty recognizing non-existent assets
    → Added data validation logic and stricter prompting for the agents.

Over-compression in P&L logic → Updated system prompt to improve separation of responsibilities.

General Task Coverage
	• Non-financial or general knowledge questions weren’t handled and 
    → Created/expanded GeneralKnowledgeAgent and added optional web search capabilities.


## 💡 Personal Note

The initial implementation was developed entirely with the assistance of Cursor. My next step is to refine the system to produce clearer, more consistent, and better-monitored results.

## 📦 Project Packaging
✔ The project uses a local dataset located at: `data/assets.parquet`  
✔ Before running, ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment
✔ Start all backend services using Docker:  
```bash
  docker compose up --build -d
```
✔ Launch the Streamlit app from the project root directory:
```bash
./run_streamlit.sh
```
